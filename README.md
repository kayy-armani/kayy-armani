# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kenneth Amaning, I am 21 years old an I am currently enrolling on a Software Engineering course at the University of Kent. I have a Year in Industry requirement on my course, hence why I have decided to gain work experience at The Commonwealth Secretariat, in order to improve my CV, and therefore better my chances of achieving a placement at the end of the next academic year.

## Areas of Study

In my course, there are many modules. One of the modules that I have found I enjoy is "*Introduction to Cyber Security*". In this module, we learn about the key aspects of *Cyber Security*, such as the 3 pillars; **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Availability**. We also look at forms of solutions to threats or attacks in this module, which I find very fascinating.

## Professional Interests

There are many things that I like to do in my spare time. One thing is to enter type racing competitions online, to try and refine my typing speed. Though it is a heavy requirement of my area of work, I am not really a fan of coding languages, as they can be quite daunting to learn.
